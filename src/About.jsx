      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I study business, but honestly, I’m more into tech, investments, and figuring things out on my own terms. I learn what interests me—whether it's coding, finance, or just random deep dives into the internet.

I like experimenting with Unity, trying to make games... until the errors and bugs make me rage-quit. Maybe someday, I’ll actually create a game worth playing. For now, I mostly build and deploy websites using the MERN stack, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and NGINX.

I also explore the dark web and chat with random people there—just for fun (or maybe curiosity is my biggest flaw). And yeah, I’m a total introvert, so this is probably the most you’ll hear from me.

Anyway, that’s me. If you’re here to check out my work, feel free to explore. Maybe we’ll build something cool together.</p>
